          <h4>Changing Mindsets</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            <b>AutoRepublic</b> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet conaims to drive two very important behavioral changes
            that can make approaching treatment faster and better. In general, a
            common person in our country is quite unwilling to see a proper
            physician for his or her illness, until it gets too bad. People try
            out different suggestions from friends around them or conduct a self
            treatment based on other's experiences. This is mainly due to
            serious lack of awareness about the signs, symptoms, consequences of
            diseases and lack of proper guidance. Secondly, when people want to
            approach treatment, they commonly get into the trouble of finding a
            right doctor. In most cases, they head to Dhaka or other big cities
            and ask their relatives or friends for help. Unfortunately, those
            relatives or friends typically know only a few doctor names. Those
            are generally the busiest doctors who are well known at the national
            level. Certainly, taking an appointment of those doctors are quite a
            hassle. One may need to wait even two-three months to consult the
            doctor. This is again mainly because, there is not enough awareness
            about the availability of many qualified doctors across the country
            who could give attention and treat the patient earlier than the time
            he/she will wait for. These result in unnecessary delays aggravating
            the condition of the disease. <b>Medify</b> through its social
            network platform and many other means is continuously engaging to
            build the awareness among people to help these improve.
          </p>
          <h4>Expansion with Impact</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            If we are to truly improve this with the right impact, we must focus
            on the people at the rural or in small cities. Providing and
            extending this service to the rural people of Bangladesh requires a
            lot of resources and activities. And, it isn't easy with the limited
            resources.
          </p>
          <h4>Present Operation</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Since the official launching on 31st October 2015, <b>Medify</b> is
            operational with full capacity in regard to providing appointments
            from doctors around the country. The service hosts information and
            appointment facilities for more than 9615 doctors from 556
            consultation centers in 63 districts. We have served a few thousand
            patients so far and have been able to bring smiles on their faces.
          </p>
          <h4>The Future</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            At <b>Medify</b>, we are confident to make a difference in how
            people of Bangladesh approach healthcare services. We have plans to
            integrate many other related services with the doctors' appointment
            in the platform in coming days. The investment from BD Venture has
            given the initiative more speed. Now, it's all about execution of
            the dreams to bring goodness out for everyone in the country.
